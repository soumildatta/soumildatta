### Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I am [Soumil](https://www.soumildatta.com/)
I am an undergraduate CS student and a research assistant at the [High Fidelity Virtual Environments Lab](https://john.cs.olemiss.edu/~jones/doku.php?id=start) at the University of Mississippi. I am curious about anything related to tech and music. I'm usually learning new things related to programming or messing around with my piano or guitar in my free time.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning iOS development and ReactJS   
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some cool things with AR technologies for research   
âš¡ Fun fact: I love building IKEA furniture
